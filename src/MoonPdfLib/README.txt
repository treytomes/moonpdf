This library originates from GitHub here:
https://github.com/reliak/moonpdf/tree/master/src/MoonPdf

The GitHub project hasn't been updated in 5 years, and seems to be fairly stable, but if needed we should be able to do a "git pull" in the C:\tfs\GuiPrograms\Development\Shared\WPF\moonpdf to update our code.

This library is a wrapper around the MuPDF C++ library, which you can learn about here: https://mupdf.com/
